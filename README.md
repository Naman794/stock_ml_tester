# 📊 Stock ML Tester

**Stock ML Tester** is a Python-based tool for analyzing stock and commodity data using machine learning models. It includes data loading, analysis, prediction, and scheduled task execution.

---

## 📘 Project Summary

### ❓ Why This Was Built

**Stock ML Tester** was created to automate the analysis and prediction of stock and commodity price movements using machine learning. It aims to assist retail investors, data analysts, and developers in:

- Understanding trends in stock and commodity markets.
- Creating ML models that can predict future performance based on historical data.
- Automating repetitive financial data processing tasks using schedulers.

By modularizing the code, the tool supports quick experimentation and continuous improvement for quantitative research and financial forecasting.

### 💼 Use Cases

1. **Quantitative Research**  
   Run experiments using real-world data to test ML models and strategies.

2. **Financial Forecasting**  
   Train models to predict trends in equity or commodity markets using available historical data.

3. **Automated Reports or Alerts**  
   Use the scheduler to automate market analysis and push results to a reporting system (e.g., dashboard, email, webhook).

4. **Model Evaluation & Comparison**  
   Extend `analysis/ml_models.py` to add new algorithms and benchmark them against existing ones.

5. **Education & Prototyping**  
   Great for ML students or data science learners who want to work on real-world financial datasets.

### 🐞 Known Bugs / To-Do Fixes

#### ❗ Bugs / Issues

- **No Input Validation on CSV Files**  
  The program assumes the CSV files (`bse_active.csv`, `commodities.csv`) are well-formatted. Adding checks for missing columns, empty rows, or bad headers is important.

- **Hardcoded Paths and Parameters**  
  Some files and parameters are hardcoded in `config.py` or individual scripts. A proper CLI or config file parser would help here.

- **Limited Logging**  
  Debugging is harder without structured logging. Implement `logging` instead of using print statements.

- **Model Persistence Issues**  
  If training fails, model save/load via `joblib` could crash without fallbacks. Needs error handling for model files.

- **Scheduler Lacks Exit Strategy**  
  The `scheduler.py` runs indefinitely. Add logic for graceful shutdown or logging execution timestamps.

#### 🛠️ Feature Suggestions

- Add unit tests to validate ML pipelines.
- Integrate a dashboard to visualize results over time.
- Add support for live stock data (e.g., via an API like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage).
- Extend support for additional ML algorithms (Random Forest, LSTM, etc.).
- Enable a REST API for triggering model evaluations or retrieving predictions.

## 🧪 How to Use

1. **Prepare your data:**
   - Place CSV files in the `data/` directory.

2. **Train or load models:**
   - Use `ml_model.py` to define, train, and evaluate models.

3. **Run main logic:**

```bash
python main.py
```

4. **Use scheduled execution:**

```bash
python scheduler.py
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The `config.py` file includes configurations like file paths, intervals, or model parameters. Modify this to change the environment or data source settings.
